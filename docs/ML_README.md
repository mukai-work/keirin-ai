# ML Pipeline Overview

This document outlines the machine learning components for Keirin AI. It covers
feature engineering, dataset preparation, model training, and evaluation. The
implementation is in progress and will be expanded as the project evolves.

## Features
- Placeholder feature extraction via `build_features`.
- Dataset splitting utilities via `make_datasets`.

Further sections will describe model architectures, calibration methods, and
backtesting results once implemented.
